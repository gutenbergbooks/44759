<h2>MAY DAY.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>Strictly according to Precedent.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Open the windows, salute the day;</p>
<p>Welcome, welcome the First of May.</p>
<p>Everything's changed, or ought to be,</p>
<p>Buds are bursting on hedge and tree.</p>
<p>Sweet winds breathe from the West or South</p>
<p>Soft as a kiss from a maiden's mouth.</p>
<p>Everything speaks of warmth and love,</p>
<p>Bright is the sun in the blue above.</p>
<p>Out in the woods, I know. I know,</p>
<p>Fur and feather are all aglow.</p>
<p>Downy rabbits with jewel eyes</p>
<p>Dart about in a wild surprise.</p>
<p>Yellow-billed blackbird, speckled thrush,</p>
<p>Pour their notes in a tuneful gush.</p>
<p>And all the neat little boys and girls,</p>
<p>With clean fresh faces and hair in curls,</p>
<p>Sing in a chorus, "Hurray, hurray!</p>
<p>April's gone, it's the First of May!"</p>

<p>The whole of the sky is wrapped in gloom.</p>

<p>In a winter-suit on the First of May.</p>

<h3 class="sans">DRAMATIC FAMILY LIKENESS.</h3>

<p>For the plot of <i>The Passport</i>,
recently produced with a fair amount
of success at Terry's Theatre, the
authors admit their indebtedness to
Colonel <span class="sc">Savage's</span> novel, <i>My Official
Wife</i>. Oddly enough, this plot
bears a considerable resemblance to
that of <i>The Orient Express</i>, a piece
"made in Germany," of which the
English adaptation was produced
here, at Daly's, during his season.
In this piece, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>The Orient
Express</i>, a gentleman has tourist
tickets for himself and wife; but
his wife, after disposing of her
ticket to a professional <i>cicérone</i>,
returns to England alone, while her
husband, travelling on business, continues
his journey. The <i>cicérone</i>
has sold the ticket cheap to a lady,
who is therefore compelled to travel
under the name inscribed on the
ticket, and finds herself in the
same carriage with the gentleman
who has the corresponding ticket,
and the ticket-collector, seeing the
same names, hands back both tickets
to the gentleman, and tries to keep
the carriage strictly reserved for
them all the way, in which attempt
he fails, and hence arise, on their
return to England, complications
analogous to those of <i>The Passport</i>.
Was the novel of <i>My Official Wife</i>
written before the German farcical
play, or is it only a family likeness?</p>

<h2>STRIKES À LA MODE DE PARIS.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>From the Diary of a Pleasure-seeker of the Future.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rose</span> early, intending to have a real good time of it, in spite of
the recent disturbances. As a precautionary measure, wore my
bullet-proof coat and shell-defying boots. Carried also my armour-plated
umbrella, which can be used (on emergencies) as a shield to
quick-firing guns. Looked out of window, and found the weather
splendid. Firing, too (which I had heard every now and again
during the night), seemingly all but ceased.</p>

<p>On reaching the street, representative of the Civil Power cautioned
me to be careful. Thanked the representative for his courtesy, and
asked why a squadron of hussars were trotting past with drawn
sabres. Was told that the soldiers were engaged in the protection
of a sweep journeying to his work in a donkey-cart.</p>

<p>Started for a stroll, but had to seek shelter in a doorway from a
volley of bullets fired in the direction of the early milkman. From
this demonstration I gathered that the food supply would be still
further restricted owing to the action of the men on strike. After
the purveyor had beaten a hasty retreat, advanced upon a strongly-fortified
position, which turned out to be, as I expected it would, a
doubly-entrenched cab-stand.</p>

<p>Only one vehicle on the rank. Engaged the cabman. Although I
was unaccompanied by a relative or friend, found the space at my
disposal distinctly limited. The top of the four-wheeler was, of
course, occupied by the customary rocket party. The box had its
usual sentry, carrying a couple of revolvers and a search-light.
Three of the seats inside were occupied by sharpshooters, and I
retained the fourth.</p>

<p>"We had better make for the river," said the officer in command,
and we fell in with the suggestion.</p>

<p>Our progress was comparatively uneventful. Certainly at the
corners of streets we had to run the gauntlet of a shower of projectiles
of various dimensions; still, the armour-plated sides of the cab
turned aside the flood of iron, and the custodians, by lying flat as
occasion required, escaped without injury. Leaving the steel-protected
cab, I embarked on board an armoured penny steamboat, and
made my way down the river. Fortunately, the helmsman was able
to avoid the submarine mines which had been laid by the Chairman
of the Strike Committee. Our voyage was also rendered exciting by
the torpedoes.</p>

<p>Having reached the last pier, I returned to land, and was sufficiently
fortunate to catch an omnibus about to start on its exciting
campaign. The route, which ran chiefly through main thoroughfares,
extended to the length of four miles. Thanks to the exertions of all
arms of the service, the distance was traversed in about three hours.
Every inch of the ground was hotly contested, but the omnibus at
length won the day. The losses on our side consisted of a colonel
killed, and seventy-four rank-and-file wounded. The casualties on
the side of the strikers were infinitely more numerous.</p>

<p>On reaching my destination, I made for home in a balloon, thus
escaping any further molestation.</p>

<h3>PRESENTED AT COURT.</h3>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I notice that "an original dramatic caricature"
is being played at the Court Theatre, under the title of
<i>Vanity Fair</i>. To prevent mistakes, I write to say at once that I am
on the eve of constructing a three-volume novel, called <i>Hamlet, Prince
of Denmark</i>; a poem, called <i>Box and Cox</i>; and a satire, called
<i>Macaulay's History of England</i>. I merely mention this fact to
protect my copyright in the names I have chosen for my new works.
I have also in contemplation the writing of a book to be entitled
<i>Adam Bede</i>, a novelette, to be known as <i>King Solomon's Mines</i>,
and a story to be y'clept <i>Treasure Island</i>. May I add that I have
also some pantomimes and eccentric ballets nearly ready that will be
christened, when completed,&mdash;<i>Esmond</i>, <i>The Virginians</i>, <i>The
Newcomes</i>,
<i>Philip</i>, and last, but not least, <i>Pendennis</i>.</p>

<p class="author">Yours truly,  <span class="sc">Nothing if not Original</span>.</p>

<p class="ind">P.S.&mdash;I am thinking of adopting as a <i>nom de plume</i> the signature
of "<span class="sc">William Makepeace Thackeray</span>."</p>

<h3>Literary.</h3>

<p class="ind3">A book is announced entitled <i>Irish Humour

followed, we hope, by a companion volume,
entitled <i>English (ill) Humour through Irish
(Whisky) Glasses</i>.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>Messrs. <span class="sc">Blackwood</span> are issuing a standard
edition of the works of <span class="sc">George Eliot</span>. <i>Adam
Bede</i>, of course, comes first, admirably
printed in dainty volumes of blue and gold.
Glancing over the work brings back to the
memory of my Baronite a certain schoolboy
who, instead of going home to dinner, used
to spend the interval in the reading-room of
a free library, literally dining off <i>Adam Bede</i>,
then just out. It will be interesting to observe
how far the public of to-day, more especially
the young men and maidens who read novels,
will take to <span class="sc">George Eliot</span>. In this new
standard edition opportunity, alike in respect
of charm and cheapness, is made alluring.</p>

<p><i>The Curse of Intellect</i> is an unattractive
title, suggestive rather of a series of essays
on the melancholy lives of certain geniuses
than of the weird tale&mdash;for such it is&mdash;of
a Man-Monkey. This story, published by
Messrs. <span class="sc">Blackwood</span>, and written by <span class="sc">Machiavelli
Colin Clout</span>, is a modern version
of <i>Frankenstein</i>, the distinction being that,
whereas <i>Frankenstein</i> constructed his own
monster, the hero of this romance, one <i>Reuben
Power</i>, finds a monster ready to hand in a kind
of "Mr. Gorilla," whom he educates to speak
a strange language, also to read, write, and
think in excellent English. This Converted
Ape kills his maker, and then considerately
puts an end to his own miserable existence; he
does not, however, possess a soul (<i>Frankenstein's</i>
Monster was also deficient in this
respect). "For O it is such a 'norrible tale;"
and, except to those who occasionally enjoy
"a 'norrible tale," this cannot be recommended
by</p>

<h2 class="sans">BLIND ALLEY-GORIES.</h2>

<p class="title2"><span class="sc">By Dunno Währiar.</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Translated from the original Lappish by Mr. Punch's own
Hyperborean Enthusiast.</i>)</p>

<h3><span class="sc">No. III.</span>&mdash;<span class="sc">A Socratic Experiment.</span></h3>

<p>The other day I went out for a walk. My thoughts circled round
my head like bees in a bonnet, and detached themselves slowly from
the loose white honeycomb of my brain to mirror themselves in my
soul, as is usual with me on
such occasions. And, somewhere
round the corner, a
voice lurked calling out remarks&mdash;what
I knew not, only
that they were of a highly
personal character. The people
I met stared at me, and I
stared at them, for I had a
presentiment that they were
talking about me, but I took
no notice of them&mdash;beyond informing
them that they were
cowards and blowflies, and requesting to be informed why they enclosed
their dirty interiors in glass. For I am Young <span class="sc">Garnaway</span>,
and when I take a walk, I generally exchange amenities of this
kind with any persons I happen to meet.</p>

<p>At the Market Place, my friend the Tallow-chandler sat inside his
shop, dozing under a pale canopy of farthing dips.</p>

<p>"Answer me a question," I begged of him. "Why does one yearn
for the top brick off the chimney when one is a child, and yet feel
dissatisfied when, as a man, one receives it on the top of one's
Sunday tile? Why does the sea bird fly inland in winter to get food
from the towns&mdash;only to turn up its beak when presented with a
ticket for soup? Why do we&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/208-1000.png"><img src="images/208-400.png" width="400" height="129" alt="'A clear and practical illustration.'" /></a>
<p class="center">"A clear and practical illustration."</p></div>

<p>My friend the Tallow-chandler answered never a word, but
chuckled foolishly to himself and retired behind a barrier of mottled
soap.</p>

<p>When I had gone a piece further I reached a back street, where I
found my friend the Bird-stuffer sitting on his doorstep, playing the
mouth-organ.</p>

<p>"Answer me a question," I besought him. "Suppose you found
out that those who hold the reins of government in our town were
educating large blue-bottle flies to make apricot jam out of your and
your neighbours' pig-wash, would you write to the local paper about
it, even if you knew that the editor would decline to insert your
letter?"</p>

<p>My friend answered never a
word; he only giggled in
embarrassment, struck up a
mazurka on his mouth-organ,
and began to dance sheepishly.</p>

<p>But, down in Mud Alley, my
friend the Dustcart-man sat
at his open window&mdash;a family
idyll, wife and six small children,
all eating onions and
fried fish.</p>

<p>"Answer me a question," I
prayed him. "If a person came to you and said rudely, 'Better
anything else than sitting here with your head in the domestic halter
among the potsherds and puffballs of the old ideals; rather a jolly
good row that ends in a fortnight's "hard" than fat-headed, elephant-footed
dulness here with your buzzing brood around you!' If a
person came to you and said that, what reply would you give him?"</p>

<p>My friend answered never a word; he was out of the window
before I had time to walk away; and in a very few moments I received

<small>TOWARDS HISTRIONICS.</small></h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Under the guidance of Herr Goethemann.</i>)</p>

<ul class="none">
<li><i>Question.</i> Have you witnessed the performance
of the Actor-manager?</li>

<li><i>Answer.</i> No, but I have perused the tragedy
of the Author-publisher.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Is it a curtain-raiser?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> No, but it is a hair-lifter, in three acts.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> How many are the persons of the drama?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Four.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Of these, how many are objectionable?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Five.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Kindly resolve this paradox.</li>

<li><i>A.</i> All are objectionable that come on the
stage, and one that doesn't.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> You speak of the stage; where has the
play been given?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Nowhere. It has not received a license.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Is it the close season?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> No, but so much private license was
taken by the Author-publisher that the public
censor did not see his way to adding to the
amount.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Then we shall not see it interpreted by
intelligent actors?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> No, for even if license were granted,
the Author-publisher would take all the
parts himself.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> I do not follow this scheme of plurality.</li>

<li><i>A.</i> I quote from his own printed advertisement,
"The right of performing in public
this play (<i>sic</i>) is reserved by the author."</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Did you state that it is a tragedy?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Yes, but inclining to farce.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Does it move the reader to pity and terror?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Yes, both. Pity for himself, and terror
of the next thing of the kind that he may
have to read.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Has it any other of the high qualities
of the Greek Tragedy?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> It says it has the unities.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> A severe attack?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> No, the Norwegian kind; a form of
Teutonic measles, painful but transitory.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Is it heroic?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> No, but it is suburban.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Is the conclusion worthy of a great
tragedy? Does it end in a lurid light of
whole-souled passion and death?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> It ends about 4 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> the next day,
with a cock crowing. The protagonist has
come home intoxicated, and remains so.
I regret to add that he pushes the heroine,
she having displaced his beverage by breaking
the glass. She slaps him upon the face,
and eventually loses animation. I do not
know how the other two end, because they
were not home in time for the curtain. As
it was, the Author-publisher nearly spoilt
one of the unities through waiting for them.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> All must be well that ends so well.
Is there a problem or enigma?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> There is always the insoluble riddle&mdash;why
did he write it?</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Is it full of situations?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Not inconveniently so; but there is a
dramatic moment.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Which?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> I do not know.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Then why do you say there is one?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Because the Author-publisher says so.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> But is it not wasteful to have three
acts, and only one dramatic moment?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> I should have thought so; but the
Author-publisher says he has shown economy.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Could you give me an idea of the manner?
Select a striking incident or a passage where
there is subtle characterisation.</li>

<li><i>A.</i> One situation impressed me very much.
I think it must have been the dramatic
moment. I reserve it for my next.</li>

<h2>BABY'S DIARY.</h2>

<p class="center">["The Nursery Tricycle contains two seats, one for the mistress and one
for the maid and her charge, and has two pairs of pedals."&mdash;<i>Daily Paper.</i>]</p>

<p>This is rather fun! Ever so much better than those crawling
old mail-carts and perambulators. Wonder mother and
nurse never thought of it before. A pneumatic tandem,
too, I notice. Hope they understand blowing tire up
again when it bursts.</p>

<p>Nurse a duffer at pedalling. A mere passenger! Have
to keep her up to the mark by crying. Frightened a
pony in a trap. Sarcastic driver said, "<i>You</i> don't want
a bell to <i>your</i> machine with that child yelling like a
tom-cat on fire." Gives me a hint&mdash;I must see how our
cat <i>does</i> yell when it's on fire.</p>

<p>Really, I never saw such steering! Mother has just
run us into a brick wall. Disgraceful! Why wasn't
she taught tricycling when she was young? Her education
has certainly been horribly neglected.</p>

<p>Why should I sit in the middle, though? Can't see
the country properly. Make another protest&mdash;louder, if
possible. Passing pedestrian observes, "You should call your machine
a crycycle, not a tricycle." Put out my tongue at him. Nurse offers to
give me a "pick-a-back"; says she can pedal too! The old humbug!
Scratch her face. Mother offers me a seat on front handle. Not half bad.</p>

<p>Fresh air makes one uncommonly hungry. Time for my bottle.
Insist on my outriders stopping at a public for milk.
Find the pony, trap, and sarcastic driver stopping there
too. Latter says to Mother, "So you've brought the
infant phenomenon with you, Ma'am!" Wonder what
he means. He adds something about a "fog-horn."
Rude, I fancy.</p>

<p>Back homewards. Awfully sleepy after that milk.
Curious milk. Perhaps sarcastic person drugged it to quiet
me? Fast asleep. Wakened by crash! Stars! Oh, <i>what</i>
is it? Try to yell&mdash;can't&mdash;mouth full of something.</p>

<p>Later. In my cot, thank Heaven! Heard doctor say,
"Severe shock, but no bones broken." Awful headache.
Seems that break went wrong going down-hill.
Well, no "safety tandem" for <i>me</i> again&mdash;can't <i>stand
'em</i>, myself, not being in favour of infanticide. Give
<i>me</i> a good old mail cart!</p>

<p>To <i>The Field</i> of April 20, Mr. <span class="sc">Frederick Milbank</span> wrote about
the "Monument to a Grouse Shooter" on Wimmergill Moor. Mr.
<span class="sc">Milbank</span> considered the number of grouse he had bagged as constituting
a "record," and so caused a monument to be erected on the
spot sacred to the memory of four thousand brace of grouse shot
in six days by five guns with one extra gun on the sixth day.
The monument, being erected, <i>scared the grouse away</i>. Of course
they read the sad story, held a council, and decided that as long
as <span class="sc">F. A. Milbank</span> was anywhere about, within shot, they would
preserve themselves by avoiding him. Subsequently the monument
was removed to Bamingham in North Yorkshire. But the North
Yorkshire birds are quite indifferent to this tale from The Hills.
They wink the other eye, that is until such time as <span class="sc">Frederick A.
Milbank</span> shall show them the sort of gun <i>he</i> is, and then they'll be
sorry for not having taken warning earlier, unless they possess the
sagacity of the grouse of Wimmergill, which resembles that of <i>Mr.
Jingle's</i> dog, who read the inscription on the board, "Gamekeeper has
orders to shoot all dogs found in this inclosure," and "wouldn't pass
it." "Singular circumstance that," said <i>Mr. Pickwick</i>. "Will
you allow me to make a note of it?"</p>

<h2>A FRIEND AT A PINCH.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>An Utterly Impossible Incident that will never be "Reported."</i>)</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Court of Law. Experienced Counsel arguing
a point in the teeth of his Lordship on the Bench.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>His Lordship</i> (<i>angrily</i>). No, Mr. <span class="sc">Bands</span>, I really cannot
agree with you. It seems to me that you are merely
wasting our time, and no doubt your own.</p>

<p><i>Experienced Counsel</i> (<i>politely</i>). Not at all, my Lord.
I scarcely venture to urge the great importance of the
matter to my client.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> No doubt; and your client showed
excellent judgment in entrusting his interests to your
hands. Still law is law, and can never be anything else.</p>

<p><i>Exp. C.</i> Your Lordship is most kind. But my point,
my Lord, is so plain&mdash;the matter is so clear. Surely your
Lordship must see it.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship</i> (<i>with much irony</i>). It is my fault, no
doubt, Mr. <span class="sc">Bands</span>, but as matter of fact your point is
absolutely lost to me. I confess I cannot see it at all.</p>

<p><i>Exp. C.</i> I would not propose for a moment that your
Lordship's judgment is at fault. But I would venture to
suggest that the atmosphere of the Court is sufficiently
dense to cloud the clearest and most brilliant intellect.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship</i> (<i>mollified</i>). There is a good deal in what
you say, Mr. <span class="sc">Bands</span>, but of course, we must put up with
it. There is no remedy.</p>

<p><i>Exp. C.</i> With every possible respect to the Bench, my
Lord, I would humbly suggest that there is a remedy.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> Can you quote a case?</p>

<p><i>Exp. C.</i> I can, at any rate, refer to an opinion.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> Has it been reported?</p>

<p><i>Exp. C.</i> Certainly, my Lord. You will find it in the
Reports of the Hardwicke Society. Lord Chief Justice
<span class="sc">Russell of Killowen</span> has laid it down that snuff is a
most valuable assistance to the proper dispensation of
justice. His Lordship has declared that the inhaling of
prepared tobacco through the nostrils "clears the judicial
brain, predisposes it to calmness and impartiality,
and enables a learned judge to listen with patience to the
most fluent and prolific of forensic orators." If your
Lordship pleases.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Offers snuff-box to the Judge.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>His Lordship</i> (<i>after taking a pinch</i>). Well, certainly
the point you have raised seems clearer to me than it did.
(<i>After a few moments of consideration.</i>) I will reserve
the case for further consideration, and will deliver judgment
later.</p>

<p><i>Exp. C.</i> As your Lordship pleases. I will ask the
usher to hand my authorities to your Lordship.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship</i> (<i>receiving snuff-box</i>). You are very
good. I will not overlook their assistance in coming to a
conclusion. I hope the occasion may never arise when I
might be compelled, as the vulgar tongue expresses it, to
"give you snuff."</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title1">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 22.</i>&mdash;Easter holidays over;
school back; new master in charge; process of installation a little
lacking in pomp and circumstance. This due in large measure to
incidence of holiday. At Westminster, as at other schools, boys
don't insist, <i>vi et armis</i>, on returning on the opening day. Wide
gaps on most of the benches; Front Opposition Bench a wilderness.
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> and all his merrie men abstained from lending to
installation of new Speaker the grace and comfort of their presence.</p>

<p>"It is quite true, dear boy," <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> said, when I gently
hinted that the Leader of Opposition should have been present on
such occasion, "that when our man was defeated I said, Mr. <span class="sc">William
Court Gully</span> having been elected by a majority of the House, is
representative of the whole House. But it's a long name, you know,
and in ordinary practice I must stop short at <span class="sc">William</span>. You can't
expect me to <span class="sc">Court Gully</span>."</p>

<p>Amid depressing circumstances as far as attendance went, new
Speaker bore himself faultlessly. Quick-change process watched
with breathless interest from Ladies' Gallery. First, Speaker-Elect,
preceded by Mace, entered, attired in Court dress with close-fitting
bob-wig. At summons of Black Rod, proceeded to House of Lords;
placed at Bar in custody of Black Rod and Sergeant-at-Arms; not
even "accommodated with a chair." There to receive <span class="sc">Her Majesty's</span>
sanction of choice of Speaker made by Commons. Happened that
the <span class="sc">Queen</span> couldn't come. One of the cloaked and wigged figures
on Woolsack mentioned the matter in charmingly casual way.</p>

<p>"It not being convenient for <span class="sc">Her Majesty</span> to be personally
present at this time," said a voice which bewrayed the <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span>,
"a Commission has been issued under the Grand Seal
empowering the Lords named therein to convey Royal Assent to
Commons' selection of Speaker."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span> quite friendly with Speaker-Elect, whom he
familiarly addressed as "Mr. <span class="sc">Gully</span>." Spoke highly of his talents,
diligence, and sufficiency to fulfil important duties to which it
had pleased majority of Commons to call him. Said he had made
it all right with the <span class="sc">Queen</span>, and that <span class="sc">William Court</span> might go
back
to Commons, and get about his business. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, not to be outdone
in geniality, begged his anonymous friend, one of five muffled
up in scarlet gowns, in the event of any mess being made with
matters in the other House, to impute the blame to him alone, and
let the other fellows go scot-free.</p>

<p>Amongst crowd of Commoners clustered behind <span class="sc">Speaker</span> there
was scarcely a dry eye when this noble sentiment was uttered.</p>

<p>"Solong!" said the voice that was certainly the <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor's</span>.
Taking this as hint to retire, <span class="sc">Speaker</span> withdrew from the Bar, and
left the House "Without a stain on his character," as the Earl of
<span class="sc">Cork</span> and <span class="sc">Orrery</span> handsomely said. Returned to Commons in
procession,
with Mace lightly but firmly carried by Sergeant-at-Arms.
Instead of taking Chair, marched round by passage to the rear,
disappeared from view. Consternation in Strangers' Gallery.</p>

<p>"He's bolted!" one gentleman whispered to his neighbour.
"Funked it when the music stopped and he came to the hosses."</p>

<p>After few moments of growing uneasiness, a fine figure, in full-bottomed
wig, silken gown, beneath which silver-buckled shoes
shimmered, emerged from behind <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> Chair, and seated itself
in it. "Order! Order!" said a full, pleasant voice; and <span class="sc">William
Court Gully</span> entered upon what promises to be a prosperous and
distinguished career.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg 216]</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Sark</span> tells me that, on going into Committee
of Supply, he intends to move that
henceforward the gallery over the Clock
facing the Chair shall be called "The
Speaker's Gullery." <span class="sc">Sark</span> always thinks
of the right thing at the right time.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;New Speaker installed.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;The Order by which Ministers
took Tuesdays having lapsed, private
Members to-night came into their own
again. Always stoutly resist incursion of
greedy Governments on their small possessions.
Might reasonably be supposed
that, having come into their inheritance,
would have made most of it. Lots of
things to do to-night. Several resolutions
on paper, with Orders of Day to follow.
What happened was that by a quarter to
nine enthusiasm finally evaporated; count
called; only thirty-seven Members responded;
lights forthwith put out.</p>

<p>Opening debate on Charity Commission
certainly a little heavy. Every Member
who got his chance felt it incumbent on
him to speak for at least half an hour.
Some considerably exceeded this limit.</p>

<p>"<i>Parturiunt montes</i>," said <span class="sc">Herbert
Maxwell</span>, wearily looking round as
<span class="sc">Griffith-Boscawen</span> followed <span class="sc">John
Ellis</span> and <span class="sc">Jesse Collings</span> succeeded
<span class="sc">Francis Stevenson</span>; "<i>nascitur ridiculus
mus</i>."</p>

<p>And so it was. Particular mountain
at work when the mouse appeared was
<span class="sc">J. W. Lowther</span>. Mouse entered from
behind <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> Chair; leisurely proceeded
along passage between Front Opposition
Bench and table at which J. W. was
speaking disrespectfully of <span class="sc">Jesse Collings</span>.
Halted by <span class="sc">Prince Arthur's</span> empty seat;
nibbled fibre of matting in remonstrance at his absence; passed
round fearlessly by J. W.'s heels; sat for moment in full view of
House listening attentively to J. W.'s argument; yawned and
sauntered back the way it came. Interest in debate evidently keener
than that of average Member. As soon as <span class="sc">Acland's</span> voice reverberated
through almost empty Chamber, mouse observed strolling
back along familiar way; took its seat on floor under shadow of Mace
in defiance of all Parliamentary rule; followed <span class="sc">Acland's</span> argument
with evidently keen interest. Interrupted by approach of <span class="sc">Richard
Temple</span>. Quickly looking up and catching sight of his stately figure
bowing to <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, mouse fled like the wind, in its terror making off
by Treasury Bench, finally escaping by another exit.</p>

<p>"<i>Cogitato</i>" said <span class="sc">Herbert Maxwell</span>, who breakfasts every
morning off a plate of porridge and a page of <span class="sc">Plautus</span>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Cogitato, mus pusillus quam sit sapiens bestia,</p>

<p class="center">Fancy Picture of Sir Thomas Esmonde bringing forward
Queen "Lily o' Killarney" Hawaii.</p></div>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;All very well for gay young
Irish baronet like <span class="sc">Esmonde</span> to champion
cause of errant Queens throned in summer
seas. Expected other things from <span class="sc">The
MacGregor</span>. House quite shocked when
he interposed just now. <span class="sc">Esmonde</span> asked
<span class="sc">Edward Grey</span> whether Government could
do anything to obtain proper treatment for
Queen of Hawaii. Before Under Secretary
could reply, <span class="sc">The MacGregor</span>, suddenly
leaping across dyke as it were, interposed.
"As I happen to know the lady
who was formerly Queen of Hawaii," said
<span class="sc">The MacGregor</span>, and so proceeded to
back up <span class="sc">Esmonde's</span> plea. Offhand way
in which reference was made suggested
illimitable possibilities, <span class="sc">The MacGregor</span>
just "happened to know" this Queen,
probably one of a bevy. On some quiet
night House might hope to hear paper
read by <span class="sc">The MacGregor</span> on "Queens I
Have Known."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sark</span> curiously anxious as to where the
acquaintance was made, and how it was
nurtured. Did <span class="sc">The MacGregor</span> vaccinate
Her Majesty whilst he, still in public
capacity, sojourned at Penrith? Was she
an inmate of Peebles Hydropathic Institute
what time he was resident physician?
or did he minister to her at the Barnhill
Hospital and Asylum, Glasgow, of which,
before he took to Imperial politics, he was
superintendent? Pleasanter still to think
of <span class="sc">The MacGregor</span> and the Queen with
the musical name wandering hand in hand
amid the orange groves of sea-girt Hawaii,
breakfasting on the bountiful bread-fruit,
lunching off the succulent yam. Did he
in those days call her so much as <span class="sc">Liliuokalani</span>?
or did he venture on the diminutive
<span class="sc">Lili</span>? <span class="sc">Sark</span> had better give
notice of these questions. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Fresh Ministerial Bills
brought in with both hands.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Another private Members' night, and, by consequence,
another count out. Things kept going till a quarter to eight, but
only with utmost difficulty. Members consented to stay in prospect
of division on <span class="sc">Albert Rollit's</span> motion protesting against exemption
of Government property from rating. But they would not longer
linger. When <span class="sc">Lubbock</span> followed, with proposal of pleasant chat
about London's share of imperial contribution to local purposes, the
few remaining Members, vainly trying to look as if they'd be "back
in ten minutes," walked out. House counted; only twenty-five
present, and so home to dinner.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said <span class="sc">Walter Long</span>, left in charge of Front Opposition
Bench, "but this won't prevent us on Monday, when <span class="sc">Squire of
Malwood</span> proposes to take Tuesday and Friday mornings for public
business, stubbornly resisting piratical incursion on the rights of
private Members. Whatever we are, let us be logical."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Ministerial defeat on <span class="sc">Rollit's</span> amendment averted
by majority of one.</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF EASTBOURNE.</h3>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Natis in usum lætitiæ rosis</p>

  </div>  </div>

<p class="ind1">It is not the English nature, but the English climate that makes
us take our pleasures sadly (if we do, which we don't). And it is not
the fault of the English nature, but of the organisers, if our public
pageants are usually, like our statues, more or less good-humoured
burlesques of what they are meant to represent. Now Eastbourne has
triumphantly shown that, in spite of chilling and heavy rain, England
can rival the sunny South in the beauty and variety of a big procession
of floral cars. And if Eastbourne can do this, why can it not
be done elsewhere? "Organise, organise, organise," and let the
hireling merrymaker be conspicuously absent. Your hireling will
still wear his armour as if he were bearing the <i>spolia opima</i> of a
burgled marine-store dealer. And the lady hireling, as a sea-nymph
or a shepherdess, can never quite forget what she owes to her dignity
as a respectable married woman. In the interests of the family exchequer,
and in the way of business, she may consent to dally with
allegory, but her heart is not in the mermaid's grot, nor do the
spacious times of Great <span class="sc">Elizabeth</span> inspire her, beyond the Victorian
circus-smile, the circus-smile which puts a girdle round about the
face for forty minutes, or more if the procession be so long a-field.
At the Eastbourne Battle of Flowers everyone lived up to his or her
coach, carriage, wheel-barrow or cart, in a way which speaks
volumes for the artistic sense of the South Saxons. The children, as
children use, took the cake&mdash;after Mr. <span class="sc">Edgar Bruce</span>. They were
there in great numbers and variety, from the little <i>Titania</i> in her
fairy goat-chaise, o'er canopied with flowers and flying doves, to the
very small skipper of the very realistic ship, who stood on the rainy
deck with drawn sword and unswerving dignity for some two hours
of constant and crowded parading. "Bravo, <span class="sc">Burnaby</span>," is the resultant
cry of gratified spectators, and better weather next time. A
better show it would be ungrateful to suggest.</p>
